    <h1>📊 ANOVA Application</h1>
    <p>
        This application utilizes ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to calculate statistical test parameters and offers a user-friendly interface for entering any number of alternatives and measurements. It also provides tools for applying contrast techniques to compare two alternatives.
    </p>
    <h2>✨ Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ANOVA Calculation:</strong> Perform statistical analysis using ANOVA to assess the variance between multiple alternatives.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for entering an arbitrary number of alternatives and corresponding measurements.</li>
        <li><strong>Contrast Techniques:</strong> Supports the application of contrast techniques for comparing two specific alternatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Customizable Inputs:</strong> Flexibility to work with various datasets and scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
